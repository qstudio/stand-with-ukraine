Stand with Ukraine Banner Plugin for WordPress.org

=== Description ===

Version 1 is very basic - a banner with a flag and a link to donate.

If there is a skilled UI designer with a few hours to spare, it would be great to improve the design and perhaps offer an alternative version also - please reach out to discuss this.

Future plans:

- Translation .po/.mo files
- Admin screen option to control
	- Select banner designs ( for example horizontal / corner triangle )
- Template editor
- Block option to include banner
- Central list of donation sources, managed from API call
