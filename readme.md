Stand with Ukraine Banner Plugin for WordPress.org

Version 0.0.1 is a very basic POC, which needs fleshing out into something more dynamic, attractive and flexible.

Future plans:

- Translation .po/.mo files
- Admin screen option to control
	- Banner visible / hidden
	- Message text
	- Select banner designs ( for example horizontal / corner triangle )
- Template editor
- Block option to include banner
- Central list of donation sources, managed from API call
